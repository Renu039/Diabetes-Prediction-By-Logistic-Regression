# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The model is trained and tested on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains various medical predictor variables.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model that can predict diabetes based on features such as:

- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Instances**: 768
- **Features**: 8 independent variables + 1 target variable (`Outcome`)

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification, which estimates the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling  
4. **Model Training**  
5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC-AUC score  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-logistic-regression.git
cd diabetes-prediction-logistic-regression
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
```

## 📌 Results

- **Accuracy**: ~80% (varies slightly depending on the train-test split)
- Visualizations and metrics are included in the notebook.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Try other classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy model as a web app
